# Gem-Game
In this game I use jQuery to fetch html elements and update them 
dynamically.

# How To Play
Each crystal is given a random number value from 1-12 and the goal is to 
reach the randomly generated magic number (19-120). If you surpass the 
magic number then you lose and the game resets. If you hit it exactly then 
you win and the game resets. Your win and loss record persists even when 
the game resets.
